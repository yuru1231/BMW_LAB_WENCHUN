# January 2026 Studying Plan (Winter Vacation)

## Overview
**Owner:** Lucy  
**Main Goals (January):**
1. Set up Github
2. Define a thesis title.
3. Reproduce seniors’ work: focus on SNS3 simulation for beam hopping and start duplicating the Hypatia simulator based on Joanna’s workflow.
4. Post daily progress updates (with GitHub evidence).
5. Review progress at the end of January.

## Weekly Milestones (Session Titles)

## Week 1 — Paper Reading & Topic Exploration
**Target Outputs:**
- Review the project report from the undergraduate student
- Review slide from CNAM, France. Find a suitable topic for cooperation.
- Reading and sycn papers

**Study Note Link:**
- M1: `https://github.com/bmw-ntust-internship/Lucy/blob/20b96d1d8f2ea04545828af6ef74fe4e57892e4b/Notes/Midterm%20Project.md`

**Deliverables:**
- [X] Screenshot/Log of successful [SNS3 build](https://github.com/bmw-ntust-internship/Lucy/blob/a3463c1a262384c92098ff67dad94e33f849ab0b/Notes/Standard%20satellite%20example%20run.md).
- [X] Output file from a standard [DVB-S2 simulation] (e.g., sim-results.txt) proving the simulator runs.

## Week 2 — Progress Confirmation & Understanding Model
**Target Outputs:**

- 2–3 thesis topic candidates (1–2 sentence problem statement each)
- Model Understanding
- SNS Setting


**Deliverables:**
- [X] Beam Hopping Simulation Log (showing beams switching active states).
- [X] Throughput Graph: Plot showing capacity shifting between beams over time.
- [X] Short Summary: "Beam Hopping verification.


## Week 3 — Duplicate the Simulator (Start Reproduction)
**Target Outputs:**
- Reproducible setup (versions, dependencies, scripts)
- Baseline scenario replication with sanity checks

**Deliverables:**
-[ ] Generated dataset folder (containing isls.txt, gsls.txt, routes.txt).

## Week 3(Renew) - Set GEO statellite to LEOs
D1 D2:[Satellite longitude changes over time, confirming LEO mobility](https://github.com/bmw-ntust-internship/Lucy/blob/147eaa7075247fad0627e82e06362ddbd7f7164b/Notes/Satellite%20longitude%20changes%20over%20time%2C%20confirming%20LEO%20mobility.md)
- [X] Run Multiple LEOs
- [X] Orbit / Mobility

D3 D4 :UT switches serving satellite due to LEO movement
- [ ] UT 不是永遠被同一顆衛星服務
- [ ] servedSatId
- [ ] handover

D5 Beam / Beam ID
- [ ] Beam footprint 隨衛星移動

## Week 4 — Thesis Title Narrowing + Experiment Design
**Target Outputs:**
- Thesis title 
- Output parsing / validation notes

**Study Note Link:**
- M4: `z`

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Successful build log of the Hypatia ns-3 module.

## End-of-January Review (Jan 31)
**Review Checklist:**
- Thesis title 
- Reproduction status (what is fully reproducible, what is not)
- Results summary
