# January 2026 Studying Plan (Winter Vacation)

## Overview
**Owner:** Lucy  
**Main Goals (January):**
1. Set up Github
2. Define a thesis title.
3. Reproduce seniors’ work: focus on SNS3 simulation for beam hopping and start duplicating the Hypatia simulator based on Joanna’s workflow.
4. Post daily progress updates (with GitHub evidence).
5. Review progress at the end of January.
